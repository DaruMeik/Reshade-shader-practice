# Reshade-shader-practice
A small project to practice making post processing shader

Language: ReShade FX shading language, a shading language that is heavily based on the DX9-style HLSL syntax, with a few extensions. 

Current shader:
 - MyPixelFX.fx: a pixelate shader. Makes the game looks more retro.
 - KuwaharaFilter.fx: a Kuwahara Filter shader. Makes the game looks like oil painting, works extremely well together with pixelate shader.
